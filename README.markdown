# Khiti Ranjan Jena's Resume Website

This is a personal resume website for Khiti Ranjan Jena, showcasing professional experience, skills, education, certifications, and achievements. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the resume website.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS styles for the website.
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript for interactive elements (toggle details).
- `assets/profile.jpg`: Profile picture (replace with your actual image).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-website.git
   ```
2. Replace `assets/profile.jpg` with your actual profile image.
3. Update any content in `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, or `js/script.js` as needed.
4. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update resume website"
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (see below).

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `resume-website`).
2. Push all files to the `main` branch.
3. Go to the repository on GitHub, navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then click **Save**.
5. Wait a few minutes, and your website will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/resume-website`.

## Notes
- Ensure the profile image (`assets/profile.jpg`) is a valid JPEG file and appropriately sized (recommended: 120x120 pixels).
- The website is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Test locally by opening `index.html` in a browser before deploying.
